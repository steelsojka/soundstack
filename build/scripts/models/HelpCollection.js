Performance is heavily affected by browser redrawing. Meters are mostly affected by this performance hit since they are redrawing at 60 FPS at optimum conditions. To counter this you can do one of 2 things:<br><br>- You can disable meters by clicking on them to toggle the drawing on and off.<br><br>- You can collapse the module to not show any of the controls.  Drawing will not occur in this state.<br><br>It may be best to toggle meters on and off with use if performance starts becoming sluggish."},{title:"Recording audio",description:'Audio can be captured and exported out of SoundStack. The audio signal coming out of the master input module is the signal that is geting recorder. Recording can be paused by hitting record again. Recording is done once the stop button is pressed. The audio data will be loaded up in an Audio Player module for further processing or export to a 16bit WAV<br><br>Audio Players can bypass the recording process by selecting "Reference" on the module.  This is useful when wanting to record a line input and not the audio player you are playing with.'},{title:"Shortcut Keys",description:"There are many shortcut keys to make using SoundStack better:<br><ul><li>Ctrl + H - Help</li><li>Ctrl + A - About</li><li>Ctrl + S - Save Stack</li><li>Ctrl + O - Open Stack</li><li>Ctrl + C - Collapse all</li><li>Ctrl + E - Expand all</li><li>Ctrl + R - Record/Pause record</li><li>Space - Global play for audio players</li><li>Ctrl + Space - Global stop for audio players</li></ul>"}];return new Backbone.Collection(e)});
